This is the GitHub for UW Bothell Institutional Research. 

Our SOP for utilizing this GitHub is to clone repositories for projects you are currently working on to your local machine and modify/run the code from there. As we upload R project files we will will be adding code within the R script that sets the R working directory to be the local clone of that repo. This will allow you to output reports to the repo as well as pull any source material such as logos or flat files from the repo. The code is setup to dynamically set the path as C:/Users/"yourusername"/Documents/GitHub which is the default location for clone repos.
